## Summary

The website is the most important online presence of any Faculty as it’s the school’s main communication interface with students, candidates, staff, researchers, alumni and the community.

The main goals of this redesign project were:

* Improve the website’s usability;
* Enhance the perceived credibility of the Institution;
* Increase the number of website visitors;
* Get more course applicants.

In this project, I handled:

* Researching;
* Reorganizing the website’s information architecture;
* Rethinking the homepage’s content structure;
* Designing the homepage’s user interface (desktop version).

## Step 1 — Interviews

I kick-started this project by conducting a couple of short interviews with some students to really **grasp what they use the site for and the main issues they have come across with while using it**.

Most interviewees said the first time they ever used the website they were looking for information on courses and applications. The following times they were mainly looking for information on the school calendar, schedules, course subjects and contacts.

Unfortunately, **the interviews revealed a correlation between the information that is most sought after and the information that is harder to find**. For example, most interviewed students said they had a hard time finding the information they needed on the course subjects, especially when regarding optional subjects, as it spreads across several website pages.

Most students also said that any information regarding enrollment and schedules should be a lot easier to find.

It’s safe to say the website’s information architecture and content strategy needed some rework.

## Step 2 — Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

Even though the website was redesigned in 2013, talking with students and analysing the website thoroughly, clarified that there was still a lot of room for improvement.

The [strengths and weaknesses analysis](https://github.com/FilipaGo/fbaul-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/strengths_weaknesses_analysis.pdf "Check out the full analysis") revealed several usability issues in terms of form and content. **The website was overly descriptive, dense and overcrowded with text, which could potentially make the user lose focus and interest.**

There were no call-to-action buttons that stimulated engagement and the homepage was poor in information. Even though the content throughout the website was thorough, it was hard to find and the blocks of text were massive, exhaustive and lacking hierarchy, which made them very **hard to read and unappealing**.

The website has a search feature, but it doesn’t work well. For example, searching for the word “pintura” (painting) shows every page that has the word “pintura”. The website would benefit a lot if it had type-ahead functionality and a smarter search engine.

New students can also have a hard time moving around campus as there doesn’t seem to be a map available.

**The main navigation is very confusing**, uses an unclear terminology and sometimes the same thing is called by different names depending on context, which is incoherent.

A user can easily feel lost when using the website and ultimately end up abandoning it due to frustration.
