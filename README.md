## Summary

The website is the most important online presence of any Faculty as it’s the school’s main communication interface with students, candidates, staff, researchers, alumni and the community.

The main goals of this redesign project were:

* Improve the website’s usability;
* Enhance the perceived credibility of the Institution;
* Increase the number of website visitors;
* Get more course applicants.

In this project, I handled:

* Researching;
* Reorganizing the website’s information architecture;
* Rethinking the homepage’s content structure;
* Designing the homepage’s user interface (desktop version).

## Step 1 — Interviews

I kick-started this project by conducting a couple of short interviews with some students to really **grasp what they use the site for and the main issues they have come across with while using it**.

Most interviewees said the first time they ever used the website they were looking for information on courses and applications. The following times they were mainly looking for information on the school calendar, schedules, course subjects and contacts.

Unfortunately, **the interviews revealed a correlation between the information that is most sought after and the information that is harder to find**. For example, most interviewed students said they had a hard time finding the information they needed on the course subjects, especially when regarding optional subjects, as it spreads across several website pages.

Most students also said that any information regarding enrollment and schedules should be a lot easier to find.

It’s safe to say the website’s information architecture and content strategy needed some rework.

## Step 2 — Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

Even though the website was redesigned in 2013, talking with students and analysing the website thoroughly, clarified that there was still a lot of room for improvement.

The [strengths and weaknesses analysis](https://github.com/FilipaGo/fbaul-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/strengths_weaknesses_analysis.pdf "Check out the full analysis") revealed several usability issues in terms of form and content. **The website was overly descriptive, dense and overcrowded with text, which could potentially make the user lose focus and interest.**

<br></br>
</p>

There were no call-to-action buttons that stimulated engagement and the homepage was poor in information. Even though the content throughout the website was thorough, it was hard to find and the blocks of text were massive, exhaustive and lacking hierarchy, which made them very **hard to read and unappealing**.

The website has a search feature, but it doesn’t work well. For example, searching for the word “pintura” (painting) shows every page that has the word “pintura”. The website would benefit a lot if it had type-ahead functionality and a smarter search engine.

New students can also have a hard time moving around campus as there doesn’t seem to be a map available.

**The main navigation is very confusing**, uses an unclear terminology and sometimes the same thing is called by different names depending on context, which is incoherent.

A user can easily feel lost when using the website and ultimately end up abandoning it due to frustration.

## Step 3 — Benchmarking

<p align="center">

Benchmarking details.
<br></br>
</p>

The [Benchmarking Analysis](https://github.com/FilipaGo/fbaul-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/raw/master/_docs_readme/benchmarking_fbaul.pdf "Download the Benchmarking") focused on **8 institutions** with art programmes and other higher education Portuguese public Schools in order to find some common ground (patterns) that could help define the redesign strategy.

I selected the sample from the list of Erasmus + hosting schools, available on the Faculty of Fine Arts website, high-ranking schools in international university rankings, other well-known Portuguese higher education institutions and well-qualified vocational schools.

**The selected institutions fell into one or more of the following categories:**

* Good visual practices;
* Erasmus + international partners;
* Prestigious institutions.

The fold, the main structural blocks and the primary content blocks.
<br></br>
</p>

**I started out by collecting the data from every institution and taking screenshots of each website homepage** (main language version) in order to:

* Pinpoint the fold and analyse the available contents without scrolling;
* Mark the website’s main structural blocks — header, body and footer;
* Trace the primary content blocks (elements) — logo, main navigation, profile navigation, search box, main banner, news and events.

There is a clear **connection between the length of the webpage and the size of its structural blocks**. Therefore, it’s good practice to balance the amount of content and the blocks’ vertical size. The contents should also have enough white space (negative space) to favour page scanning.

The page header is always fully visible above the 768 px. fold, even though its size varies a lot.

The body’s height also varies, and it’s never fully displayed above the 1080 px. fold. The body is always the longest structural block.
There doesn’t seem to exist a direct connection between the body’s height and the footer size.

Except for profile navigation, **all elements are standard** (logo, main navigation, main banner, search box, news and/or events). There is also a pattern as to its location.

**The most relevant content blocks like the logo, main navigation, search box and banner (hero) are always above the 768 px. fold.**

Every website has a news section that starts above the 1080 px. fold. It rarely begins above the 768 px. fold and it always surpasses the 1080 px. fold. **The number of news is highly variable.**

The logo is always in the header, on the left, even though it varies in size and format.

Most websites’ main navigation is in the header, horizontally displayed. It usually spreads across the full width of the page or half. It’s always above the 768 px. fold.

All websites have a search box usually on the top right corner, above the 768 px. fold.

**The main navigation first-level options vary from 4 to 12. The menu usually unfolds.**

The main banner (hero) is always visible above the 768 px. fold, full-width, sometimes inside the header, others in the body. It’s usually dynamic.

Most websites have quick links in the body, either shown as text hyperlinks or secondary menus. The footer also capitalizes its space with hyperlinks that mimic some main navigation options.

**There seems to be a pattern when it comes to displaying the school’s contacts in the footer or at least place a link to a contacts page.**

None of the websites displays a sitemap.

**All websites are responsive** and load in the institution’s head office native language but most have an English version.

The institution’s intranet is usually accessible using login credentials.

**Most websites provide links to the school’s social networks.**

Only one website displays the date of the site’s last update.

## Step 4 — Current Information Architecture and Content Inventory

</p>

Documenting the [original information architecture and contents](https://github.com/FilipaGo/fbaul-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/raw/master/_docs_readme/information-architecture_original.xlsx "Download the original information architecture and content inventory") showed that the website was quite dense and complex, making it difficult for both current and new users to find the content they needed.

Besides, there were **too many main navigation entries** that had poorly grouped second-level options sometimes leading to repeated content.

The main navigation terminology wasn’t also great and didn’t clearly imply which sub-level options might be accessed when hovering over a menu item.

## Step 5 — New Information Architecture

<p align="center">

<br></br>
</p>

The insights provided by the previous steps helped me rearrange the [new information architecture](https://github.com/FilipaGo/fbaul-redesign-desktop-site-prototype/raw/master/_docs_readme/information-architecture_new_v04.xlsx "Download the new information architecture") and prioritize content according to the projects’ goals and the users’ needs.

<br></br>
</p>

I was able to **shorten the main navigation first-level items to 6 options** that are actually relevant and use a clearer terminology. I also **remodelled the sub-level options** to assure a more intuitive navigation and quicker access to the most sought-after contents, both by current and future students.

To highlight the prestige and credibility of the Institution, I **gave more prominence to the University’s research departments**, laying-out direct links to their about page, researchers page, etc.

I also introduced a new menu option called “Viver” (Living) that displays a set of useful links to information that can **help new students** get a feeling of what it’s like to live in Lisbon, study at the Faculty of Fine Arts and apply for financial support.
