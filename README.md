## Summary

The website is the most important online presence of any Faculty as itâ€™s the schoolâ€™s main communication interface with students, candidates, staff, researchers, alumni and the community.

The main goals of this redesign project were:

* Improve the websiteâ€™s usability;
* Enhance the perceived credibility of the Institution;
* Increase the number of website visitors;
* Get more course applicants.

In this project, I handled:

* Researching;
* Reorganizing the websiteâ€™s information architecture;
* Rethinking the homepageâ€™s content structure;
* Designing the homepageâ€™s user interface (desktop version).
